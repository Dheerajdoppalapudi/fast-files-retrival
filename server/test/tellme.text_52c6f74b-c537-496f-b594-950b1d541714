I am Ankit. I am pursuing my b.tech in computer science from KIIIT university Odisha. Along with my persuing,
I completed django node.js flutter courses on udemy and various technology I learned that help me developing 
of my project called murls,featherfy. and also i sucessfully completed my winter intership during my 3rd year
of college. i am quick learner and during my pervious internship i came to know that i am also team player.


    




i can learn how a product based company is built, how different things work and contribute in not just my 
department that is tech but other departments as well

ta pare even the small contributions that I would make would have direct impact to the growth of the company

whereas in an mnc it is just a small contribution only where the big picture of my contribution is not
visible

ta pare your motive right now when you are starting your career is not pay or stability, it is more
learning than anything else that is only possible at a startup and not at an established mnc

you get to work with all the people very closely because of smaller team and they are more like your friends 
than colleagues so that is great
