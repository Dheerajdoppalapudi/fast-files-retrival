we have data set
in which diffrenty type of feature like currency custome number and invoice id etc;
first we have to check null or duplicate value

we can do 3 thing of these value , mean or median, count the percentange if is its less then remove it

we have to look for constant and kausick constan. to find the kausik using thresold function.
we can delete these bwacuse it did not effect the modele

we have condvert day to month or day;
then look for catgeorical value then do encoding.
encoding are two type
1 nominal there is no order.
2 odinal-foloow particula order(herical)

here we can do 3 type of encoding 
1 level
2 binary
3 one hot

here we have use one hot encoding in which we diivde the category  to 0 to n-1 ;
aftere that feture extraction;
the feture which is useful for modele or new feature to extracted

we can do feature extraction using two way
1 forward propagtion - here we compare with two coulum and see the model prpagion

2 backward prpoagtion - here we take n colum and each step n-1 propagtion to find how data is performing 
if we remove the single column from data;

now we devide the data intow three type 
1 train set ->traing the model
2 test set
3 validation set -> here we check for model is underfit or overfit;
underfitr -> if the model performing is bad in all these set then it said to underfit , to overcome using add 
extra feature or do forwar and backward popagtion.
overfit->here model value on train set 90% but not in test set , so there may data lekage , to overcome using
remove the some etxar feture and remove model complexity ;


here 5 model 
linera regration y=mx+c;
svr -> we draw such line on hyperplane so the maximum point covered the such line
decision tree -> here this regration take column as proprerty and do some gain enthalpy and see that if there multiple feture of this proprty then branch into the leaves,
random forest regration -> it sis bagging model,bootstrap model,multiple decion tree,it improvesion on each step during clsssifacion on feature,here we take avereg score of n desion tree
xgb boost-> it step wise, at fisrt it run only one decion tree and check for on what feature model is perforing bad, here is trying to perform goood in this tree.
